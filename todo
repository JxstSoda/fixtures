# Functions and Effects I wish to have
Hey there Romchick! Some primary features I wish to have are a GROUP 1 and GROUP 2 folder or value inside the actual model
(same config as Inertia OR C-lighting)
I would like it to have a beam and gobos, (spinning). I would like it to have bump, fade, sine, rand effects all of those
I would like to have a stunning beam texture to come with the light, along with some beam dim effects.
I want it to have as much effects as you can this is going to be a top-teir light.
# Moving and Positions
I would like it to have a tilt, pan, and 2-3 circle effects
About 8 or 9 positions on the keyboard and what not
# Keybinds
I would love it to have a LOT of keybinds, you can pick and choose what keybinds you wish along with what effects but let's keep panel space down to a minimum.
# Effects
Heres the main idea in mind. 
5 FX
4 FX (DIM)
4 VFX
1 MFX
2 CFX (RGB in and OUT)
FX CIRCLE
FX TILT
FX PAN

(YES THESE ARE A COPY OF FIXTURES ADVANCED, however I wish for the same features but feel free to add or remove some just to keep it original.)
# Faders
I would like to have around 5 faders or less
BPM
DIM
SINE
DIV
SOON( REALLY WANT ZOOM)
# COLORS
I would LOVE to have a color wheel.
11 COLORS
BEAM LENGTH
SELECTION WITH THE COLOR WHEEL
PRESET COMBONATIONS
# KEYBINDS LIST
I prefer to have speeds, gobo spin, gobo O/F, beam O/F, beam texture O/F, some positions and effects, pretty much everything but again feel free to pick and choose.
